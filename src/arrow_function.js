/*
"Arrow functions" were introduced with ES6 as a new syntax for writing JavaScript functions.
They provide us with an alternative way to write a shorter syntax as compared to the regular function.
Thus we can say that Arrow Functions save a developerâ€™s time and simplify code development.
Points to understand:
No function keyword 
No function name
A list of arguments within parenthesis, followed by a 'fat arrow' (=>), followed by a function body.
