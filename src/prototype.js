/* 
    * Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
    
    * This mechanism can be used to inherit properties from function constructor
    and also we can add properties and methods to the function constructor .

    * This is called prototypical chaining.With the help of prototypical chaining 
    inheritance can be acheived.
