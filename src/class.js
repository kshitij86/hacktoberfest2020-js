/**
 * In javascript Classes are special function which is a template to create objects.
 * 
 * Similar to function in classes we can have class expression and class declaration.
 * 
 * An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that 
   function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. 

 * You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise it will throw reference error.
